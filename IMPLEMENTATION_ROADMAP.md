# Implementation Roadmap Summary

## Branch: `architecture-refactor`

This branch contains the complete architecture refactor plan for the Deep Research MCP tool. The refactor addresses critical issues in the current monolithic design and provides a path to a scalable, maintainable architecture.

## Quick Start for Implementation

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install additional dependencies for Phase 1
npm install pino pino-pretty inversify reflect-metadata

# Install additional dependencies for Phase 2  
npm install ioredis lru-cache p-retry
npm install --save-dev @types/node @types/pino
```

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Foundation
**Goal**: Establish core patterns and extract critical services

**Priority Order**:
1. **Day 1-2**: Result types & error handling (`src/shared/Result.ts`)
2. **Day 3-4**: Structured logging (`src/infrastructure/logging/Logger.ts`)
3. **Day 5-6**: Configuration management (`src/config/AppConfig.ts`)
4. **Day 7-8**: Source evaluation service (`src/domain/sources/`)
5. **Day 9-10**: AI model optimization (`src/infrastructure/ai/`)

### Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Performance & Scalability
**Goal**: Optimize memory usage and implement adaptive systems

**Priority Order**:
1. **Day 11-12**: Search client abstraction (`src/infrastructure/search/`)
2. **Day 13-14**: Streaming content processing (`src/infrastructure/content/`)
3. **Day 15-16**: Adaptive concurrency control (`src/infrastructure/metrics/`)
4. **Day 17-18**: Multi-level caching (`src/infrastructure/cache/`)
5. **Day 19-20**: Research service extraction (`src/domain/research/`)

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Layered Architecture**
```
MCP Interface → Application Layer → Domain Layer → Infrastructure Layer
```

### 2. **Result Types Over Exceptions**
```typescript
// Instead of: throw new Error("Failed")
// Use: return Err(new SearchError("Failed"))
```

### 3. **Dependency Injection**
```typescript
// Services injected via constructor, not imported directly
constructor(
  private searchClient: SearchClient,
  private modelProvider: ModelProvider
) {}
```

### 4. **Structured Logging**
```typescript
// Instead of: console.log("Search completed")
// Use: logger.info("Search completed", { duration, resultCount })
```

## Expected Improvements

### Performance Targets
- **Research Time**: <30s for depth=3, breadth=3 (currently ~45-60s)
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB per session (currently ~800MB+)
- **Concurrency**: 10+ simultaneous requests (currently limited to 2)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >70% for repeated queries

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Test Coverage**: >90% (currently ~60%)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: <10 per function (currently 15-20)
- **File Size**: <500 lines per file (currently 600+ in deep-research.ts)
- **Error Handling**: Predictable Result types vs exceptions

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Breaking MCP Interface**: Maintain backward compatibility
2. **Performance Regression**: Continuous benchmarking
3. **External API Changes**: Abstract behind interfaces

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep original files during migration
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Completion
- [ ] All console.log replaced with structured logging
- [ ] Configuration centralized and validated  
- [ ] Source evaluation extracted to service
- [ ] AI calls optimized with batching
- [ ] Test coverage >85%

### Phase 2 Completion
- [ ] Memory usage reduced by 40%
- [ ] Adaptive concurrency implemented
- [ ] Multi-level caching operational
- [ ] Research service extracted
- [ ] Performance targets met

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1, Day 1-2**: Implement Result types
2. **Follow the daily guides**: Each day has specific tasks and code examples
3. **Run tests continuously**: Maintain >85% coverage throughout
4. **Monitor performance**: Use benchmarks to validate improvements
5. **Document changes**: Update README and API docs as you go

## Files Created in This Branch

### Planning Documents
- `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` - Overall strategy and timeline
- `phase1-implementation.md` - Detailed Phase 1 guide with code examples
- `phase2-implementation.md` - Detailed Phase 2 guide with code examples
- `src/architecture-proposal.md` - Technical architecture analysis
- `src/framework-recommendations.md` - Technology stack improvements
- `src/performance-analysis.md` - Performance optimization strategies

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during implementation:

1. **Check the daily guides** - They include common pitfalls and solutions
2. **Run the existing tests** - Ensure no regressions
3. **Use feature flags** - Implement changes gradually
4. **Monitor performance** - Use the provided benchmarking code

The architecture is designed to be implemented incrementally, so you can stop at any point and still have a working system with improvements.
